MultiscaleTemplateMatching.py: 
Python file containing methods for single image template matching using Canny edge detection. 
Method utilizes normalized template matching correlation coefficient. 

MultiscaleTemplateMatching_testfile.py: 
Python file running test for canvas images 'pepsi_image0{1-9}.jpg' against single template 'pepsi_template.png'. 

Improvements/fixes: 
- Augmentation needed for multiple object detection in single canvas image. 
- Canvas images are scaled manually for 50 different scale sizes in ranges 0.1-2.0. Augmentation needed to scale images according to 
  original image size. 
- Augmentation needed for accuracy validation and establishing ground truth.
